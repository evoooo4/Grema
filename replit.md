## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- `npm run dev`: Starts development server with hot reload
- Frontend served by Vite dev server
- Backend runs with tsx for TypeScript execution
- Database migrations with `npm run db:push`

### Production Build
- `npm run build`: 
  - Builds frontend with Vite (outputs to dist/public)
  - Bundles backend with esbuild (outputs to dist/index.js)
- `npm start`: Runs production server
- Static files served from dist/public
- Backend serves both API and static assets

### Environment Configuration
- **NODE_ENV**: Development/production mode switching
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)

The application follows modern web development practices with TypeScript throughout, comprehensive form validation, responsive design, and a clean separation between frontend and backend concerns. The architecture supports both development and production environments with appropriate tooling for each.
